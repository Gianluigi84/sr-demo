Welcome to the Shadow Robot Demo's documentation!
=================================================

In this page are listed some demos for the EtherCat Shadow robot Hand. The main goal of these demos is to give an overview about
the capabilities of the hand and to provide some examples from which is possible to learn how to use the hand.
